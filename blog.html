        <h2>Blackhole</h2>
        <img src="blackhole.jpeg" alt="blackhole">
        <p>A black hole is a region in space where gravitational forces are so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This phenomenon occurs when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel and collapses under its own gravity, leading to a singularity—a point of infinite density. The boundary surrounding a black hole is called the event horizon; once anything crosses this threshold, it is irrevocably drawn into the black hole.</p>
        <p>Black holes can be categorized into three main types: stellar black holes, formed from collapsing stars; supermassive black holes, which reside at the centers of galaxies and can contain millions to billions of solar masses; and intermediate black holes, which are less understood and lie between the two.</p>
        <p>Despite being invisible, black holes can be detected through their interactions with nearby matter. As material spirals into a black hole, it heats up and emits X-rays, providing astronomers with clues about their existence. Black holes challenge our understanding of physics, particularly in relation to the fundamental nature of space, time, and gravity. Ongoing research continues to explore their enigmatic properties, shedding light on the cosmos and the fabric of reality itself.</p>

        <h2>Eclipse</h2>
        <img src="eclipse.webp" alt="eclipse">
        <p>An eclipse is a celestial event that occurs when one astronomical body moves into the shadow of another body, temporarily obscuring it from view. There are two primary types of eclipses: solar and lunar.</p>
        <p>A solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes directly between the Earth and the Sun, casting a shadow on Earth. This can be total, where the Sun is completely obscured, or partial, where only a portion is covered. Total solar eclipses are rare and create dramatic changes in daylight, causing the sky to darken and temperatures to drop.</p>
        <p>A lunar eclipse, on the other hand, occurs when the Earth passes between the Sun and the Moon, causing the Earth’s shadow to fall on the Moon. This can also be total, partial, or penumbral, with total lunar eclipses often giving the Moon a striking reddish hue, known as a "blood moon."</p>
        <p>Eclipses have fascinated humans for centuries, inspiring myths and scientific inquiry. They offer valuable opportunities for scientists to study the Sun’s corona and the Earth-Moon system. Each eclipse is a reminder of the intricate dance of celestial bodies in our solar system, captivating observers around the world with their beauty and rarity.</p>

        <h2>MOXIE Oxygen Experiment</h2>
        <img src="moxi.jpg" alt="moxi">
        <p>The MOXIE (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment) experiment, part of NASA's Perseverance rover mission, aims to produce oxygen from the carbon dioxide-rich Martian atmosphere. Launched in 2020, MOXIE represents a critical step toward enabling human exploration of Mars.</p>
        <p>The device works by using a process called solid oxide electrolysis, where it extracts oxygen molecules from carbon dioxide (CO₂), which makes up about 95% of Mars' atmosphere. During its operation, MOXIE heats the CO₂ to around 800 degrees Celsius and uses an electrochemical reaction to separate the oxygen from carbon monoxide (CO), generating roughly 6 grams of oxygen per hour—enough to support a small fire or a single astronaut’s breathing for about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>MOXIE’s successful operation demonstrates the potential for in-situ resource utilization, which could be vital for future manned missions to Mars. By producing oxygen on Mars, astronauts could reduce the amount of oxygen needed to be transported from Earth, making missions more sustainable and cost-effective. Over the course of the Perseverance mission, MOXIE is expected to conduct multiple runs, providing crucial data for future exploration and helping pave the way for humanity’s journey to the Red Planet.</p>
