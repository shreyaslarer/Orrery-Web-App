    A detailed explanation of the project, its objectives, and the technologies used.<br>
    Key Features of the Interactive Orrery Web App:
    1.Real-Time Celestial Tracking:
     Displays real-time positions and orbits of planets, NEAs, NECs, and PHAs using NASA data.
     Dynamic and accurate simulation of celestial movements.
<hr>
     2.3D Interactive Visualization:
     Users can zoom, pan, and rotate to explore the solar system in a fully immersive 3D environment.
     Celestial bodies are scaled and rendered with visually appealing graphics using Three.js or WebGL.
<hr>
     3. Educational Tooltips and Info Panels:
     Detailed information about each celestial body, including size, composition, orbital parameters, and scientific significance.
     Makes complex astronomical concepts easily understandable for users.
<hr>
    4.PHA Deflection Simulation:
    Interactive feature allowing users to simulate asteroid deflection strategies like kinetic impact or gravity tugs to push PHAs into safer orbits.
<hr>
    5.Asteroid Mining Simulation:
    Gamified exploration of asteroid mining, where users can select NEAs to assess for potential resource extraction.
    Provides insights into future asteroid mining missions and their feasibility.
<hr>
    6.Data from NASA APIs:
    Integrates real-time data feeds from NASA, ensuring accurate depictions of orbital paths, velocity, and close approaches of asteroids to Earth.
<hr>
    7.User-Friendly Interface:
    Intuitive controls and clean UI with buttons, sliders, and tooltips to ensure easy navigation for users of all levels.
    Interactive timeline to see future or past movements of celestial bodies.
<hr>
    8.Educational and Public Outreach Focus:
    Designed to be a tool for educators, students, and space enthusiasts, fostering curiosity and learning about our solar system.
<hr>
    9.Expandable Features:
    Potential extensions for Virtual Reality (VR) experiences or more complex simulations of space missions.
